# Abstract Algebra

Groups: 
    - Operations * preformed on a group G element g stays in the group (closed under the opration)
    - inverses, or opposite elements
    - When opposites combine they form an identity
    - An identity combined with another element g is still g 
    - associativity

Abelian Groups (commutative groups):
    - Groups that also hold under commutativity

Subgroup: 
    a subset of elements within a group G that is still a group
    Trivial ones:
    - {e}
    - G 
    For subgroup H, it is denoted H<=G "H is a subgroup of G" 

Cayley Tables: 
    Like multpilication tables, but generalized for elemnts of all groups

Legranges Theorem:
    That for group G, all subgroup orders must divide G.
    Proof: 
        take G, and subgroup H. Then H has the identity too 0G. Take 
        an element not in H but in G g1. Construct g1H. g1H will be 
        of order H, though share no common elements. As assume they did intersect, then 
        g1 * h1 = h2, however that must mean g1 = h1/h2 but that's in H, but g1 is not in 
        H. 
        If we continue to construct H until we can no more, order of cosets generated
        divide the order of the group. OTHER SUBGROUPS are just sets, not groups.
        The number of cosets is denoted the index of H in G : "|G:H|". 
        number of cosets = d, order of H = k, order of G = n, then 
        d*k = n. 

Normal Subgroups: 
    - N <= G such that it's cosets form a group, denoted N <|=G
        i.e., -yNy = N for any y in G 
    Proof: 
        take two cosets x*y in (xN)(yN)=xyN, take arbirtrary n 
        xn1*yn2 = xyn3
        -x*xn1*yn2 = -x*xyn3 
        n1*yn2 = yn3
        -yn1*yn2 = n3
        -yn1y = -n2n3

    Identity: N 
    Inverse: xN is -xN

Quotient/Factor Group:
    - subgroup H of G, such that G/H denotes H splitting G into cosets of order H. 
    THIS cannot form a group if H is not a normal subgroup. 

Simple Groups:
    - groups that only consist of the two trivial groups

Cyclic Groups:
    - If a group G is generated by a single one of its elements, then it is a Cyclic group
    There are finite and infinite 
    There are only two, 

    Infinite:
        Z, as <1> generates all Z 1, it's inverse, identity {-1,0,1} now all its repeated
        applications {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
    Finite: 
        Z/Zn form the only finite groups, which are just residue classes of n

    for [a] to generate Z/Zn gcd(a,n) must be 1
    and the trivial group {e}

Homomorphism: 
    Comparing two groups (G, *) and (H, ^),
    for a function 
    f: G -> H 
    x |-> f(x) 
    y |-> f(y)
    Then f(x*y) = f(x) ^ f(y)

    entries x and y in the cayley table map to an entries f(x) and f(y) in the H from G. So 
    so must their f(x*y), and in that entry must be f(x) ^ f(y)

    it is possible that many elements in G map to H

    __
    Map: inverses -> inverses and identities to identities
    

Isomorphism:
    A Homomorphism that is one-to-one and onto, i.e., Homomorphism is bidirectional from G to H.
    In otherwords they seem to behave identically under the caley table, where each elements map 
    perfectly to one another in entires.

    a copy of the group structure 

Kernel: 
    The set of elements in G, which all map to the identify of H. 
    This means G is not one-to-one and some elements x,...,y map to 1H 

    it can be thought of as: The kernel measures to which a group isn't 1-1 

    for example if g1=g2 as they both map to H then 
    g1-g2 = e. And g1-g2 = some element, therefore the identity along with 
    that element are in the kernel. 

    the number of duplicates equates the number of kernel order

    denoted ker(f) = {x in G | f(x)=1H}

First Isomorphism Theorem: 
    G/ker(f) cong(Isomorphic) img(f)


Order of an Element: 
    group G with identity e, x in G has order
