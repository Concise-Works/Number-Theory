# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute! Just fork the repository, once edits are complete, submit a pull-request.

## Guidlines:
Don't
1. Do not use words like "trivially, obviously, clearly" as if it were, there would be no need to state it.
2. Do not open sentences with "to which we mean" or "and for that matter we can say." Instead keep text dry, say "I.e.," or "then."
3. Do not skip steps (no stone left unturned).
4. Do not indent math. Only indent when giving historcal contexts or context unrelated to math.
5. Do not write blocks of text. If you reach 3 blocks, it either must be crucial or must be reworded.
6. Do not break Theorem boxes between pages. If your text is too large, break it into parts.
7. Put non-critical information into Tip boxes
8. Put some-what critical information into Note boxes

## Mission
Text books should operate as dictionaries of knowledge, not stories or a display of skill.
Things ought to be consise and well written, so much so, that a laymen could understand at a highlevel what each definition or theorem means.
